# Test generated by RoostGPT for test testfirst_approach using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

"""
1. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as 0 and num_primes as 5
    - Expected Result: The function should return an array of first 5 prime numbers [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

2. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as 10 and num_primes as 5
    - Expected Result: The function should return an array of 5 prime numbers starting from 10 [11, 13, 17, 19, 23].

3. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as a prime number and num_primes as 1
    - Expected Result: The function should return an array with the next prime number only.

4. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as a non-prime number and num_primes as 1
    - Expected Result: The function should return an array with the immediate next prime number.

5. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as a negative number and num_primes as 5
    - Expected Result: The function should return an array of first 5 prime numbers [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] as negative numbers can't be prime.

6. Scenario: Function is called with num_primes as 0
    - Expected Result: The function should return an empty array as no prime numbers are requested.

7. Scenario: Function is called with num_primes as a negative number
    - Expected Result: The function should return an empty array as negative prime numbers can't exist.

8. Scenario: Function is called with start_from and num_primes as very large numbers
    - Expected Result: The function should handle large numbers and return the correct prime numbers without any performance issues.

9. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as a floating point number and num_primes as 5
    - Expected Result: The function should consider the integer part of the floating point number and return the correct prime numbers.

10. Scenario: Function is called with start_from as a prime number and num_primes as a floating point number
    - Expected Result: The function should consider the integer part of the floating point number and return the correct prime numbers.
