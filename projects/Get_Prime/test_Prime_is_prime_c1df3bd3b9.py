"""
1. Scenario: Test when num is a prime number
   - Given num is a prime number (for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.)
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return True

2. Scenario: Test when num is not a prime number
   - Given num is not a prime number (for example, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.)
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return False

3. Scenario: Test when num is a negative number
   - Given num is a negative number (for example, -1, -2, -3, etc.)
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return False as negative numbers cannot be prime

4. Scenario: Test when num is zero
   - Given num is zero
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return False as zero is not a prime number

5. Scenario: Test when num is one
   - Given num is one
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return False as one is not a prime number

6. Scenario: Test when num is a large prime number
   - Given num is a large prime number (for example, 7919, 104729, etc.)
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return True

7. Scenario: Test when num is a large non-prime number
   - Given num is a large non-prime number (for example, 7918, 104728, etc.)
   - When the function is_prime is called with num
   - Then the function should return False

Note: The test scenarios assume that the function is_prime is designed to determine if a given number is a prime number or not. However, based on the provided function implementation, it will always return True regardless of the input, which is not the correct behavior for checking prime numbers.
