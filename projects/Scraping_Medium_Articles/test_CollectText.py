Scenario 1: Validating the Title and URL extraction
Details: 
  TestName: test_title_url_extraction
  Description: This test verifies that the function is able to accurately extract and return the URL and Title from a given 'soup' object.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Preparing a 'soup' object with predefined title and URL.
  Act: The function will be invoked by passing the 'soup' object. 
  Assert: The test will assert the presence and correctness of the title and url within the output.
Validation: 
  This test is important to check whether the function is properly parsing and extracting the webpage's title and url. As these are principal elements of our output data, it is crucial to verify their correct extraction.

Scenario 2: Testing the handling of INTRODUCTION section
Details: 
  TestName: test_introduction_section
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly identify and parse the introduction section.
Execution: 
  Arrange: A soup object is setup with a known introduction section.
  Act: Call the function under test with the 'soup' object.
  Assert: The test will check the existence and correctness of the INTRODUCTION section from the output.
Validation: 
  The introduction section often contains vital data regarding the webpage's content. As such, it is important to verify if the function is correctly extracting this section.

Scenario 3: Testing Section and Subsection extraction
Details: 
  TestName: test_section_subsection_extraction
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly identify and parse subsequent sections and subsections.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Prepare a soup object with predefined sections and subsections.
  Act: Call the function under test with the prepared 'soup' object.
  Assert: The output from the function is checked for the presence and correctness of all sections and subsections.
Validation:
  Sections and subsections contain much of the meat of the content. As such, it's important to verify if the function is correctly parsing these sections.

Scenario 4: Testing purify function call and data cleansing
Details:
  TestName: test_purify_function_call_and_data_cleansing
  Description: This test is to ensure that the 'purify' function is called during execution and cleanses data appropriately.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Prepare a 'soup' object embedded with raw HTML tag texts.
  Act: Call the function under test with the 'soup' object.
  Assert: Check the output of the function to confirm that text is cleansed and HTML tags are removed accurately.
Validation:
  To ensure the sanity of the data, it is important to verify if 'purify' function is being called and it is cleansing the scraped webpage content by removing HTML tags before returning. 

Scenario 5: Testing the Exception Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_handling
  Description: This test aims to verify that the function can correctly handle exceptions and prevent unwanted crashes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a 'soup' object in such a way that will force the function to enter its exception handling code.
  Act: The function will be invoked with the now malfunctioning 'soup' object.
  Assert: Confirm that the system doesn't crash and the function returns a valid output.
Validation:
  As this function serves as a critical scraping tool, we need to ensure it can handle unexpected content without crashing. This safeguard ensures the function's robustness in various circumstances.
