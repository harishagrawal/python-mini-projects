Scenario 1: Validate correct return of image links from a non-empty HTML response
Details:
  TestName: test_return_of_img_links_from_non_empty_html
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly gets image links from a non-empty HTML response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-empty HTML response body which contains multiple image tags with 'src' attribute.
  Act: Pass this response to the get_img_links function.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value matches the number of image sources mentioned in the HTML body.
Validation:
  The test checks the ability of the function to correctly extract image links from a non-empty HTML response which is one of the key responsibilities of this function.

Scenario 2: Validate correct return of image links from an HTML response with no image tags
Details:
  TestName: test_return_of_img_links_from_html_with_no_img
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles an HTML response which does not contain any image tags.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an HTML response body which does not contain any image tags.
  Act: Pass this response to the get_img_links function.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns an empty list.
Validation:
  The test ensures the function accurately processes HTML responses without any image tags and does not return a value when there are no image links to extract.

Scenario 3: Validate behavior with an HTML response with image tags but no 'src' attribute
Details:
  TestName: test_return_of_img_links_from_html_with_img_no_src
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles an HTML response which contains image tags but they do not have 'src' attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an HTML response body with image tags but no 'src' attributes.
  Act: Pass this response to the get_img_links function.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns an empty list.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the function checks for the 'src' attribute in the image tags and does not return them if the attribute is not present. 

Scenario 4: Validate correct extraction of image links from a complex HTML response
Details:
  TestName: test_return_of_img_links_from_complex_html
  Description: The test is designed to assess if the function correctly processes a complex HTML response containing nested elements and multiple image sources.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a complex HTML response body with nested elements and multiple image tags with 'src' attributes.
  Act: Invoke the get_img_links function, passing this complex HTML response.
  Assert: Compare the returned list with the expected list of image sources for equality.
Validation:
  The ability of the function to process a complex HTML response and extract the correct image links is central to this function's intended use in a web scraping context.
