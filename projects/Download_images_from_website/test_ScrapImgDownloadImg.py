ROOST_METHOD_HASH=download_img_c3dc3564a6
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=download_img_4cf4d88f36

Scenario 1: Successful image download and saved with the correct extension.
Details:
  TestName: test_image_download_success_with_extension
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the image is downloaded successfully and saved in a file with the correct extension.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock URL with a valid image and known extension (e.g., .jpg or .png).
  Act: Invoke the download_img function using the mock URL.
  Assert: Check that a new file has been created with the specified extension, containing the image data.
Validation:
  Rationale: The ability to download the image and correctly identify and assign its extension is crucial to the function's core functionality. Thus, its success ensures the accurate operation of the download_img method.

Scenario 2: Valid image URL, but the image could not be downloaded.
Details:
  TestName: test_failed_downloading_image_due_to_network_issues
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle situations when the image cannot be downloaded due to network problems.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an image URL and simulate network failure using requests mock.
  Act: Invoke the download_img function with the mocked image URL.
  Assert: Check that no new file is created, reflecting the failure in image download.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test is important as it validates the function's robustness in case of network issues.

Scenario 3: Image URL without an extension.
Details:
  TestName: test_image_download_success_without_extension
  Description: This test verifies that an image is correctly downloaded when the URL lacks an extension.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a mock image URL without an extension.
  Act: Invoke the download_img function with the provided URL.
  Assert: Check that a .jpg file is created (default extension for unknown types).
Validation:
  Rationale: It's essential to verify that the function can still process and download images even if the provided URL lacks an extension.

Scenario 4: Image URL contains an invalid extension.
Details:
  TestName: test_image_download_with_invalid_extension
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle situations when the image URL contains an invalid extension.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an image URL with an invalid extension (not in the list of ".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif").
  Act: Invoke the download_img function using the mocked image URL.
  Assert: Check that a new file is created with the .jpg extension.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test validates how the function behaves when encountered with an unsupported or invalid image extension, thus ensuring its robust handling of diverse input formats.

Scenario 5: Image URL is a non-image file.
Details:
  TestName: test_nonimage_file_download_attempt
  Description: This test examines whether the function correctly reacts when faced with a non-image URL.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid URL pointing to a non-image file (e.g., a text file or a PDF).
  Act: Call the download_img function with the non-image URL.
  Assert: Assert that no new file is created, indicating download wasn't initiated.
Validation:
  Rationale: This scenario is important because it tests the function's resilience in handling URLs that point to non-image resources, ensuring that it doesn't process inappropriate data types.
