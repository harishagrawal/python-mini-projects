================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The use of random.randint for generating bill numbers may not provide enough entropy for secure bill number generation, potentially leading to predictability in bill number sequence.
Solution: Use a more secure random number generator, such as os.urandom or secrets module for generating bill numbers to prevent predictability.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: While not directly visible in the provided code snippet, if any credentials or sensitive data are hard-coded in the application, it could lead to unauthorized access if the code is exposed.
Solution: Remove any hard-coded credentials and use environment variables or a secure credential storage solution to handle sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The data from the clear_data function may be reflected back in the UI without proper sanitation, leading to potential XSS attacks if the data includes executable code.
Solution: Ensure all dynamic data displayed in the UI is properly escaped or sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: There is no validation on the phone number and bill number inputs. Malformed input could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement thorough input validation for all user inputs, including phone numbers and bill numbers, to ensure they conform to expected formats.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
Issue: If the application logs sensitive information such as customer names or phone numbers without proper masking, it could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that no sensitive data is written to logs, or that it is properly anonymized or masked if it must be logged.

Vulnerability: CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk
Issue: If the application stores sensitive data such as customer information or transaction details in cleartext, it could be compromised if the storage medium is accessed.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data before storing it on disk and ensure that the encryption keys are managed securely.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Clear data when user confirms the action
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_data_on_user_confirmation
  Description: Verify that all the set values are reset to their initial state when the user confirms the action in the messagebox.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True, simulating user confirmation.
  Act: Call the clear_data method.
  Assert: Check that all attributes are set to their initial values (0 or "" as appropriate).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that when the user wants to clear the data, the system correctly resets all fields, allowing for a new bill to be created without any old data.

Scenario 2: Do not clear data when user cancels the action
Details:
  TestName: test_do_not_clear_data_on_user_cancellation
  Description: Verify that none of the set values are changed when the user cancels the clear action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return False, simulating user cancellation.
  Act: Call the clear_data method.
  Assert: Check that all attributes retain their current values and are not reset.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by checking that the system respects the user's decision to not clear the data, thus preventing accidental data loss.

Scenario 3: Ensure a new bill number is generated on clear
Details:
  TestName: test_new_bill_number_generation_on_clear
  Description: Verify that a new bill number is generated every time the clear_data method is called and user confirms the action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True and mock random.randint to control the random number generation.
  Act: Call the clear_data method twice.
  Assert: Check that the bill_no is different after each call to clear_data.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that a unique bill number is generated for each transaction, which is crucial for record-keeping and auditing purposes.

Scenario 4: Verify welcome_bill method is called after clear
Details:
  TestName: test_welcome_bill_called_after_clear
  Description: Ensure that the welcome_bill method is called after the clear_data method successfully clears the data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True and mock the welcome_bill method.
  Act: Call the clear_data method.
  Assert: Verify that the welcome_bill method is called once after clearing the data.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the system's user interface is reset and ready for a new bill entry after the clear action is performed, as per the expected workflow.

Scenario 5: Validate reset of customer details on clear
Details:
  TestName: test_reset_customer_details_on_clear
  Description: Verify that customer details are also cleared when the data is reset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True and set customer details to non-empty values.
  Act: Call the clear_data method.
  Assert: Check that customer details (c_name, c_phone) are reset to empty strings.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the customer's personal details are not retained once the data is cleared, maintaining privacy and preparing the system for the next customer.

Scenario 6: Validate that clear_data does not alter unrelated attributes
Details:
  TestName: test_unrelated_attributes_unchanged_on_clear
  Description: Ensure that clear_data does not inadvertently reset or alter any attributes that it should not touch.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the messagebox.askyesno to return True and set up a control attribute to monitor.
  Act: Call the clear_data method.
  Assert: Check that the control attribute remains unchanged.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the clear_data method has no side effects on system attributes that are unrelated to the billing process, preserving the integrity of the system's state.
