================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code does not validate the input from the .get() methods, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if non-numeric inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the values retrieved from the .get() methods are numeric and within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency (CWE-829)
Issue: The code imports modules without verifying their integrity or ensuring they are from a trusted source.
Solution: Use a package manager that supports dependency verification, such as pipenv, and consider pinning dependencies to specific, vetted versions.

Vulnerability: Arithmetic Issues (CWE-682)
Issue: The code performs arithmetic operations without handling potential exceptions such as division by zero, which could cause the application to crash.
Solution: Add exception handling around arithmetic operations to manage cases like division by zero and other arithmetic errors.

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The code does not account for the possibility of integer overflow when performing arithmetic operations, which could lead to incorrect calculations.
Solution: Check for integer size limits before performing arithmetic operations and use data types that can handle larger numbers if necessary.

Vulnerability: Improper Output Neutralization (CWE-79)
Issue: The code directly sets GUI component values with string concatenation, which could lead to GUI manipulation if the input strings are not properly sanitized.
Solution: Sanitize inputs before using them to set GUI component values or use parameterized methods for setting values to prevent GUI manipulation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Proper calculation of medical items total
Details:
  TestName: test_medical_items_total_calculation
  Description: Verify if the total price of medical items is calculated correctly by multiplying the quantities by respective unit prices and summing them up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `get` method of medical items to return predefined quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check if `total_medical_price` is equal to the expected sum based on mocked quantities and unit prices.
Validation:
  Ensuring accurate calculation of medical items total is critical for maintaining correct billing. The test verifies that the business logic for calculating medical items' total is in line with the pricing strategy.

Scenario 2: Correct computation of medical tax
Details:
  TestName: test_medical_tax_calculation
  Description: Ensure that the medical tax is computed correctly as 5% of the total medical price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize medical items with known quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check if `c_tax` is exactly 5% of `total_medical_price`.
Validation:
  The test validates that medical tax is applied correctly according to tax regulations, which is crucial for legal and financial accuracy.

Scenario 3: Accurate calculation of grocery items total
Details:
  TestName: test_grocery_items_total_calculation
  Description: Confirm that the total price of grocery items is calculated correctly by the predefined unit prices and quantities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `get` method of grocery items with fixed quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Ensure `total_grocery_price` reflects the correct sum of grocery items.
Validation:
  This test is important to affirm that the grocery billing component functions as expected, ensuring that customers are charged the right amount for their purchases.

Scenario 4: Correct grocery tax calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_grocery_tax_calculation
  Description: Check if the grocery tax is computed correctly as 5% of the total grocery price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize grocery items with known quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Verify that `g_tax` is 5% of `total_grocery_price`.
Validation:
  Grocery tax computation must adhere to tax laws, and this test ensures compliance with such financial regulations.

Scenario 5: Proper calculation of cold drinks total
Details:
  TestName: test_cold_drinks_total_calculation
  Description: Verify that the total price for cold drinks is correctly calculated based on the quantities and unit prices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `get` method for cold drinks items with predetermined quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check if `total_cold_drinks_price` is equal to the expected total.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the cold drinks pricing is accurate, which is essential for maintaining customer trust and correct billing.

Scenario 6: Accurate calculation of cold drinks tax
Details:
  TestName: test_cold_drinks_tax_calculation
  Description: Ensure that the cold drinks tax is calculated correctly as 10% of the total cold drinks price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize cold drinks items with known quantities.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check if `c_d_tax` is exactly 10% of `total_cold_drinks_price`.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the tax on cold drinks is calculated in accordance with the specified tax rate, which is essential for accurate tax reporting.

Scenario 7: Correct total bill calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_total_bill_calculation
  Description: Ensure that the final total bill is the sum of all item totals and their respective taxes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize all item quantities and mock the `get` method for each item category.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Verify that `total_bill` is the sum of all item totals and taxes.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the final bill presented to the customer includes all items and taxes, which is fundamental for transaction integrity.

Scenario 8: Zero quantity edge case
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_quantity_edge_case
  Description: Check if the method handles cases where the quantity of all items is zero, resulting in zero totals and taxes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `get` method of all items to return zero.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Ensure that all totals and taxes are zero.
Validation:
  This edge case test ensures that the system can handle situations where no items are purchased, which is necessary for system robustness.

Scenario 9: Negative quantity error condition
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_quantity_error_condition
  Description: Validate that the method handles negative quantities appropriately, which might indicate a system error or data entry issue.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `get` method of any item to return a negative quantity.
  Act: Call the `total` method.
  Assert: Check for proper handling of negative quantities, such as raising an exception or setting the total to zero.
Validation:
  Testing for negative quantities is important to ensure that the billing system is robust against incorrect data inputs and can handle such scenarios gracefully.
