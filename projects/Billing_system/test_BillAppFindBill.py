================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code uses os.listdir() and directly accesses files based on user input (self.search_bill.get()). This could allow an attacker to provide a malicious path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the user input before using it to access files. Use os.path.abspath() to get the absolute path and check if it starts with the expected directory path before accessing files.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate the user input for the bill number (self.search_bill.get()). This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement strict input validation for the bill number. Ensure that it only contains allowed characters and matches the expected format. Reject or sanitize any input that does not meet the validation criteria.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The code reads the contents of a file and inserts it into a text area (self.txtarea) without any filtering or sanitization. If the file contains sensitive information, it could be exposed to unauthorized users.
Solution: Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access the bills. Sanitize the file contents before displaying them in the text area to prevent any potential injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided Bill_App.find_bill method:

Scenario 1: Valid Bill Number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_with_valid_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the function can find and display the correct bill details when a valid bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a bill file with a known bill number in the "bills/" directory.
  Act: Set the search_bill attribute to the known bill number and call the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the txtarea widget contains the expected bill details.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly searches for and displays the bill details when a valid bill number is provided, meeting the requirement of retrieving the correct bill information.

Scenario 2: Invalid Bill Number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_with_invalid_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the function displays an error message when an invalid bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no bill file exists with the invalid bill number in the "bills/" directory.
  Act: Set the search_bill attribute to an invalid bill number and call the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that an error message box is displayed with the text "Invalid Bill No".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the case when an invalid bill number is provided and displays an appropriate error message, meeting the requirement of validating user input.

Scenario 3: Bill Number Not Found
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_with_nonexistent_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the function displays an error message when a non-existent bill number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no bill file exists with the given bill number in the "bills/" directory.
  Act: Set the search_bill attribute to a non-existent bill number and call the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that an error message box is displayed with the text "Invalid Bill No".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the case when a bill number is provided but no corresponding bill file exists, displaying an appropriate error message and meeting the requirement of handling missing bills.

Scenario 4: Empty Bill Number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_with_empty_bill_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty bill number correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the search_bill attribute to an empty string.
  Act: Call the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that an error message box is displayed with the text "Invalid Bill No".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the case when an empty bill number is provided, displaying an appropriate error message and meeting the requirement of validating user input.

Scenario 5: Bill Details Display
Details:
  TestName: test_bill_details_displayed_correctly
  Description: Verify that the function correctly displays the bill details in the txtarea widget.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a bill file with known contents in the "bills/" directory.
  Act: Set the search_bill attribute to the corresponding bill number and call the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the txtarea widget contains the exact contents of the bill file.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately retrieves and displays the bill details in the txtarea widget, meeting the requirement of presenting the correct bill information to the user.

These test scenarios cover the main aspects of the find_bill method's business logic, including handling valid and invalid bill numbers, dealing with non-existent bills, managing empty input, and verifying the correct display of bill details. They ensure that the function behaves as expected and handles various scenarios appropriately.
