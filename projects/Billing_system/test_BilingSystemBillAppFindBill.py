================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function 'find_bill' does not validate or sanitize the input 'self.search_bill.get()', which could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and access unauthorized files.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the provided bill number does not contain path traversal characters such as '../'. Consider using a secure method to join paths or a whitelist approach to validate bill numbers.

Vulnerability: CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup
Issue: The file object 'f1' is not always closed properly on function exit which can lead to file descriptor leaks. The 'close' method is called inside a loop but not executed if an exception occurs before it.
Solution: Use the 'with' statement to open the file which ensures that the file is closed properly even if an exception is raised.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The code does not set explicit file permissions for created files, potentially leading to overly permissive files that could be read or modified by unauthorized users.
Solution: Set appropriate file permissions when creating new files. Consider using 'os.chmod' or 'os.umask' to set restrictive permissions and protect the files from unauthorized access.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the existence of the 'bills/' directory before attempting to list its contents, which could result in an unhandled exception if the directory does not exist.
Solution: Before listing files in the 'bills/' directory, check if the directory exists and is accessible. Handle cases where the directory might not exist by using 'os.path.isdir' or similar functions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Bill exists and is found
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_when_bill_exists
  Description: Verify that when a bill with the given bill number exists in the "bills/" directory, the method finds the bill and populates the text area with its content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock bill file with a specific name in the "bills/" directory. Set up the Bill_App object with the search_bill attribute containing the bill number corresponding to the mock file.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Check that the text area is populated with the content of the bill file, and no error message is shown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method functions correctly when the bill is present in the system, which is the primary use case of the method.

Scenario 2: Bill does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_when_bill_does_not_exist
  Description: Ensure that when a bill with the given bill number does not exist in the "bills/" directory, the method shows an error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the "bills/" directory does not contain a bill file with the given bill number. Set up the Bill_App object with the search_bill attribute containing a non-existing bill number.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Confirm that an error message is displayed indicating the bill number is invalid.
Validation:
  This test validates the method's error handling capabilities when a user searches for a bill that does not exist.

Scenario 3: Multiple bills exist, one matches the search
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_among_multiple_files
  Description: Confirm that the method correctly identifies and retrieves the bill when multiple bill files exist, and only one matches the search criteria.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple mock bill files in the "bills/" directory, including one that matches the search criteria. Set up the Bill_App object with the search_bill attribute containing the correct bill number.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Verify that the text area is populated with the content of the correct bill file, and no error message is shown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can accurately find a bill among several others, which is important for robustness in a system with many records.

Scenario 4: Bill exists with the same name but different file extension
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_with_different_extension
  Description: Verify that the method ignores files with the same name but different extensions that do not match the expected bill file format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock bill file with the correct name but a different extension in the "bills/" directory. Set up the Bill_App object with the search_bill attribute containing the bill number.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Confirm that an error message is displayed, indicating the bill number is invalid, as the file extension does not match the expected one.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's ability to disregard non-matching file types, which is important for ensuring the integrity of the bills being searched for.

Scenario 5: Directory does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_when_directory_missing
  Description: Ensure that the method handles the situation where the "bills/" directory does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Remove or rename the "bills/" directory to simulate its absence. Set up the Bill_App object with a valid search_bill attribute.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error handling mechanism is triggered, such as an exception or an error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle exceptional situations gracefully, such as missing resources, which is crucial for the robustness of the application.

Scenario 6: Bill file is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_when_file_is_empty
  Description: Verify that the method can handle the case where the bill file exists but is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty mock bill file with the correct name in the "bills/" directory. Set up the Bill_App object with the search_bill attribute containing the bill number.
  Act: Call the find_bill method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Confirm that the text area remains empty and no error message is shown.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when encountering an empty bill file, which may be a valid scenario that should not result in an error message, depending on business requirements.
