================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-327
Issue: use of wildcard imports (from tkinter import*) can lead to namespace pollution and potential security risks
Solution: use explicit imports instead, e.g., import tkinter as tk; from tkinter import messagebox

Vulnerability: cwe-73
Issue: os module is imported but not used, unnecessary imports can lead to potential security risks
Solution: remove unused imports, only import modules that are necessary for the script to function

Vulnerability: cwe-209
Issue: potential information disclosure through messagebox, an attacker could use this to gather information about the system
Solution: limit the information displayed in the messagebox, ensure sensitive data is not exposed

Vulnerability: cwe-252
Issue: unvalidated user input (op > 0) can lead to potential security risks
Solution: validate user input, ensure the input is expected and handled correctly

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `exit_app` method:

**Scenario 1: Exit Application Confirmed**
Details:
  TestName: `test_exit_app_confirmed`
  Description: Verify that the application exits when the user confirms exit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Bill_App` object and set up the tkinter environment.
  Act: Call the `exit_app` method.
  Assert: Check that the `root` window is destroyed after confirmation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the application exits as expected when the user confirms exit, meeting the business requirement of providing a clean exit mechanism.

**Scenario 2: Exit Application Cancelled**
Details:
  TestName: `test_exit_app_cancelled`
  Description: Verify that the application does not exit when the user cancels exit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Bill_App` object and set up the tkinter environment.
  Act: Call the `exit_app` method and simulate a cancel response.
  Assert: Check that the `root` window is not destroyed after cancellation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the application does not exit unexpectedly when the user cancels exit, meeting the business requirement of providing a reliable exit mechanism.

**Scenario 3: Message Box Displayed**
Details:
  TestName: `test_exit_app_message_box_displayed`
  Description: Verify that the exit confirmation message box is displayed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Bill_App` object and set up the tkinter environment.
  Act: Call the `exit_app` method and check if the message box is displayed.
  Assert: Check that the message box is displayed with the correct title and message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the exit confirmation message box is displayed as expected, meeting the business requirement of providing a clear exit confirmation.

**Scenario 4: Root Window Not Destroyed Initially**
Details:
  TestName: `test_exit_app_root_window_not_destroyed_initially`
  Description: Verify that the `root` window is not destroyed before calling the `exit_app` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Bill_App` object and set up the tkinter environment.
  Act: Check the state of the `root` window before calling the `exit_app` method.
  Assert: Check that the `root` window is not destroyed initially.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `root` window is not destroyed unexpectedly before the user confirms exit, meeting the business requirement of providing a reliable application state.

**Scenario 5: Error Handling**
Details:
  TestName: `test_exit_app_error_handling`
  Description: Verify that the application handles unexpected errors gracefully during exit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Bill_App` object and set up the tkinter environment. Simulate an unexpected error during exit.
  Act: Call the `exit_app` method.
  Assert: Check that the application does not crash or raise an unhandled exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the application handles unexpected errors gracefully during exit, meeting the business requirement of providing a robust application.
