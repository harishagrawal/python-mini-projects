================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The code does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL and gain unauthorized access to the database.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or an ORM to safely escape user input before including it in SQL queries. Validate and sanitize all user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The 'eval' function is used on user input, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Deserializing untrusted data can lead to remote code execution.
Solution: Avoid using 'eval' on user input. Instead, use safer methods to parse data such as 'ast.literal_eval'. Validate deserialized data before using it.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Hard-coded database credentials are present in the code. If the code is compromised, an attacker could gain access to the database.
Solution: Store secrets like database credentials in a separate configuration file or environment variables. Do not hardcode secrets in source code.

Vulnerability: CWE-94: Improper Control of Code Generation
Issue: The code uses string formatting to construct SQL queries. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL if user input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or an ORM instead of string formatting to construct SQL queries. Sanitize any user input included in queries.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided `Bill_App.total` method:

```
Scenario 1: Calculate Total Medical Price
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_total_medical_price
  Description: Verify that the total medical price is calculated correctly based on the quantities and prices of medical items.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of medical items (hand_gloves, sanitizer, mask, dettol, newsprin, thermal_gun) using the corresponding instance variables.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the total_medical_price attribute is equal to the expected value calculated manually.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the total medical price calculation is accurate and follows the business logic of summing up the individual item prices multiplied by their quantities.

Scenario 2: Calculate Medical Tax
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_medical_tax
  Description: Verify that the medical tax is calculated correctly based on the total medical price.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of medical items to achieve a specific total medical price.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the c_tax attribute is equal to the expected value, which is 5% of the total medical price rounded to 2 decimal places.
    - Check if the medical_tax attribute is set to the correct string representation of the tax value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the medical tax calculation is accurate and follows the business requirement of applying a 5% tax rate to the total medical price.

Scenario 3: Calculate Total Grocery Price
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_total_grocery_price
  Description: Verify that the total grocery price is calculated correctly based on the quantities and prices of grocery items.
Execution:
  Arrange:

    - Set the quantities of grocery items (rice, food_oil, wheat, daal, flour, maggi) using the corresponding instance variables.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the total_grocery_price attribute is equal to the expected value calculated manually.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the total grocery price calculation is accurate and follows the business logic of summing up the individual item prices multiplied by their quantities.

Scenario 4: Calculate Grocery Tax
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_grocery_tax
  Description: Verify that the grocery tax is calculated correctly based on the total grocery price.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of grocery items to achieve a specific total grocery price.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the g_tax attribute is equal to the expected value, which is 5% of the total grocery price rounded to 2 decimal places.
    - Check if the grocery_tax attribute is set to the correct string representation of the tax value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the grocery tax calculation is accurate and follows the business requirement of applying a 5% tax rate to the total grocery price.

Scenario 5: Calculate Total Cold Drinks Price
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_total_cold_drinks_price
  Description: Verify that the total cold drinks price is calculated correctly based on the quantities and prices of cold drink items.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of cold drink items (sprite, limka, mazza, coke, fanta, mountain_duo) using the corresponding instance variables.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the total_cold_drinks_price attribute is equal to the expected value calculated manually.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the total cold drinks price calculation is accurate and follows the business logic of summing up the individual item prices multiplied by their quantities.

Scenario 6: Calculate Cold Drinks Tax
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_cold_drinks_tax
  Description: Verify that the cold drinks tax is calculated correctly based on the total cold drinks price.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of cold drink items to achieve a specific total cold drinks price.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the c_d_tax attribute is equal to the expected value, which is 10% of the total cold drinks price rounded to 2 decimal places.
    - Check if the cold_drinks_tax attribute is set to the correct string representation of the tax value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the cold drinks tax calculation is accurate and follows the business requirement of applying a 10% tax rate to the total cold drinks price.

Scenario 7: Calculate Total Bill
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_total_bill
  Description: Verify that the total bill is calculated correctly by summing up the total prices and taxes of medical, grocery, and cold drink items.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of the Bill_App class.
    - Set the quantities of medical, grocery, and cold drink items to achieve specific total prices and taxes.
  Act:
    - Call the total method.
  Assert:
    - Check if the total_bill attribute is equal to the expected value, which is the sum of total_medical_price, total_grocery_price, total_cold_drinks_price, c_tax, g_tax, and c_d_tax.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the total bill calculation is accurate and follows the business requirement of summing up all the total prices and taxes to arrive at the final bill amount.
```

These test scenarios cover the main aspects of the `Bill_App.total` method's business logic, including the calculation of total prices for medical, grocery, and cold drink items, as well as their respective taxes and the overall total bill. The scenarios focus on verifying the correctness of the calculations based on the provided quantities and prices of items.
