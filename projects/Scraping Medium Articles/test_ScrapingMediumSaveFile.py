Scenario 1: Save file when target directory does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_save_file_when_no_target_directory
  Description: The test is intended to verify if the function can create necessary directory structure before saving the file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a file content that does not exist in present working directory. 
  Act: Invoke save_file function with created file content.
  Assert: Check if the file is created in the expected directory with expected file name.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to ensure the functionally of handling missing directory and necessary directory creation functionality. It tests if function can handle these scenarios without crashing and performs necessary operations to save the file as intended.

Scenario 2: Save file when target directory already exists 
Details:
  TestName: test_save_file_when_target_directory_exists
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function saves file properly if the target directory already exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test file content as input and assure the target directory exists. 
  Act: Invoke save_file function with created file content.
  Assert: Check if the file with expected content exists in the target directory.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies if the functions writing mechanism works correctly when the path already exists. The file write operation should be handled properly and no existing files should be harmed during the process.

Scenario 3: Save file with complex string as title 
Details:
  TestName: test_save_file_with_complex_string_title 
  Description: The test is intended to verify if the function can handle complex string title containing spaces, special characters etc. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a test file content with complex string title as input. Make sure there are spaces and special characters in the title.
  Act: Invoke save_file function with created file content.
  Assert: Check if file is created with expected name (special characters and spaces are handled) in target directory.
Validation:
  This becomes important to test if function can handle unstructured inputs and still perform as expected. Title containing spaces and special characters can bring in complexities while creating file; this test will ensure such cases are handled.

Scenario 4: Save file when thereâ€™s low disk space 
Details:
  TestName: test_save_file_low_disk_space
  Description: The test aims to verify the function's behavior when there is low disk space.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a low disk space environment. 
  Act: Invoke save_file function with created file content.
  Assert: Check for any required exceptions or error behaviors.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that function can handle such scenarios smoothly and should not break or cause any system issues when disk space is low. Instead, it should provide appropriate error messages. 

Note: Python does not provide built-in functionality to simulate low disk space. This testcase may require specialized setup or it can be an observational testcase.
