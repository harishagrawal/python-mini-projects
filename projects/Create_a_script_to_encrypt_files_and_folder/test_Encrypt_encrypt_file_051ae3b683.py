Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-sample using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-0613

Test Scenario 1: File to be encrypted exists and is accessible
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is accessible
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should read the file, encrypt the content and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 2: File to be encrypted does not exist
- Given the file specified in the path does not exist
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 3: File to be encrypted is empty
- Given the file specified in the path exists but is empty
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should create an encrypted file with the ".bin" extension, but the file should also be empty as there was no content to encrypt

Test Scenario 4: File to be encrypted is not readable (due to permissions or other reasons)
- Given the file specified in the path exists but is not readable
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 5: Encrypted file cannot be written (due to permissions or other reasons)
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is readable, but the location does not have write permissions
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 6: Encrypt a large file
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is very large
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file without any memory issues or performance degradation

Test Scenario 7: File to be encrypted contains non-ASCII characters
- Given the file specified in the path exists and contains non-ASCII characters
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file, and the encrypted file should be able to be decrypted back to the original content

Test Scenario 8: Multiple calls to encrypt the same file
- Given the file specified in the path exists and has been encrypted before
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should overwrite the previously encrypted file with a new encrypted file
