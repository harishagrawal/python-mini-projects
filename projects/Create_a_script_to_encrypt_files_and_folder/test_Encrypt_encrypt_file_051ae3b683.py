Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-sample using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-0613

Test Scenario 1: File to be encrypted exists and is accessible
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is accessible
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should read the file, encrypt the content and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 2: File to be encrypted does not exist
- Given the file specified in the path does not exist
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 3: File to be encrypted is not readable (permission issue)
- Given the file specified in the path is not readable due to permission issues
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 4: File to be encrypted is empty
- Given the file specified in the path is empty
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the empty file and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 5: Encrypted file cannot be written (permission issue)
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is readable, but the new file with ".bin" extension cannot be written due to permission issues
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 6: Encryption of a large file
- Given the file specified in the path is very large
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 7: Encryption of a binary file
- Given the file specified in the path is a binary file
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 8: Encryption of a file with special characters 
- Given the file specified in the path contains special characters
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension
