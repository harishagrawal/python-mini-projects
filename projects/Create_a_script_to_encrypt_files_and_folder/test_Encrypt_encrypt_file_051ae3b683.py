Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-sample using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-0613

Test Scenario 1: File to be encrypted exists and is accessible
- Given the file specified in the path exists and is accessible
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should read the file, encrypt the content and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 2: File to be encrypted does not exist
- Given the file specified in the path does not exist
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 3: File to be encrypted is not readable
- Given the file specified in the path is not readable (due to permissions, etc.)
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 4: Encrypted file cannot be written
- Given the file to be encrypted exists and is readable
- And the location where the encrypted file needs to be written is not writable (due to permissions, etc.)
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should raise an exception

Test Scenario 5: File to be encrypted is empty
- Given the file specified in the path is empty
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should create an encrypted file with the same name but with ".bin" extension and this file should also be empty

Test Scenario 6: File to be encrypted contains non-ASCII characters
- Given the file specified in the path contains non-ASCII characters
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should read the file, encrypt the content (including non-ASCII characters) and write the encrypted content to a new file with the same name but with ".bin" extension

Test Scenario 7: File to be encrypted is very large
- Given the file specified in the path is very large (more than 1GB)
- When the function `encrypt_file` is called with the path as the parameter
- Then the function should successfully encrypt the file without running out of memory or crashing.
