Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-sample using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-0613

1. **Scenario:** Check if the function is able to traverse through all the files in the directory correctly
    - **Given:** A directory with nested subdirectories and files
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify each file and its path in the directory and its subdirectories are printed correctly

2. **Scenario:** Check if the function is able to encrypt all the files in the directory
    - **Given:** A directory with multiple files
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that each file in the directory is encrypted

3. **Scenario:** Check if the function is able to encrypt files in nested subdirectories
    - **Given:** A directory with nested subdirectories and files
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that each file in the directory and its subdirectories is encrypted

4. **Scenario:** Check how the function handles an empty directory
    - **Given:** An empty directory
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that the function does not throw any errors and handles the situation gracefully

5. **Scenario:** Check how the function handles a directory with no readable files (only directories)
    - **Given:** A directory with no readable files, only subdirectories
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that the function does not throw any errors and handles the situation gracefully

6. **Scenario:** Check how the function handles a directory with hidden files
    - **Given:** A directory with hidden files
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that the hidden files are also encrypted

7. **Scenario:** Check how the function handles a directory with files that the user does not have permissions to access
    - **Given:** A directory with files that the user does not have permissions to access
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path of the directory
    - **Then:** Verify that the function handles the situation correctly, possibly by skipping the files or by throwing an error

8. **Scenario:** Check how the function handles a non-existent directory
    - **Given:** A non-existent directory path
    - **When:** The `encrypt_dir` function is called with the path
    - **Then:** Verify that the function throws an error indicating that the directory does not exist.
